'''Assignment =  Declare a div() function with two parameters.
Then call the function and pass two numbers and display their division.'''


# Declaring the function

def div(num_1,num_2):
    division = num_1 / num_2         # calculating division of two numbers
    return division

result = div(22,4)
print("the division of two numbers - ",result)  #printing the result

'''Output'''

'''the division of two numbers -  5.5'''
